introduce ways to track:
	Xcage cleanliness for organic dogs
	Xshelter litter box cleanliness for organic cats
	Xoil/maintenance level for robot animals

	XEncapsulate all instance variables.
	XAssign appropriate visibility modifiers to methods only used internally by a class or within a class hierarchy.

	Xcreate a model that allows for dogs and cats, either of which may be robotic

	Xintroduce an attribute (instance variable) representing overall health that is updated as a result of other attributes moving Xin a negative or positive direction, influencing happiness

	Xoiling robotic pets
	Xwalking dogs, decreasing the likelihood that organic dogs will soil their cages, while increasing happiness in all dogs

	Xmodify the tick method to return a value indicating the amount of waste a pet creates, which should contribute to either:
		Xamount of waste in the litter box
		Xamount of waste in an individual dog cage





Xdo not allow:
	Xfeeding/watering robotic pets
	Xoiling organic pets


Xintroduce methods that allow for:
	Xoiling/maintaining all robotic pets
	Xcleaning dog cages
	Xemptying the litterbox
Xmodify existing methods to only feed/water pets that are not robotic	


Xadd options to:
	Xwalk all dogs
	Xclean dog cages
	Xclean the shelter litterbox
	Xoil all robotic pets

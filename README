introduce ways to track:
	cage cleanliness for organic dogs
	shelter litter box cleanliness for organic cats
	oil/maintenance level for robot animals

	Encapsulate all instance variables.
	Assign appropriate visibility modifiers to methods only used internally by a class or within a class hierarchy.

	create a model that allows for dogs and cats, either of which may be robotic

	introduce an attribute (instance variable) representing overall health that is updated as a result of other attributes moving in a negative or positive direction, influencing happiness

	oiling robotic pets
	walking dogs, decreasing the likelihood that organic dogs will soil their cages, while increasing happiness in all dogs

	modify the tick method to return a value indicating the amount of waste a pet creates, which should contribute to either:
		amount of waste in the litter box
		amount of waste in an individual dog cage





do not allow:
	feeding/watering robotic pets
	oiling organic pets


introduce methods that allow for:
	oiling/maintaining all robotic pets
	cleaning dog cages
	emptying the litterbox
modify existing methods to only feed/water pets that are not robotic	


add options to:
	walk all dogs
	clean dog cages
	clean the shelter litterbox
	oil all robotic pets
